01.Introduction

    ::What is Shadow Suite Framework?
        -Shadow Suite Framework is an ethical hacking toolkit, made by the Shadow Team
	 (https://github.com/Sh4d0w-T34m). The framework is made up by scripts made by
	 different authors, in different languages. As of this writing, Shadow Suite
	 Framework has 38 module installed. Written mainly in Python, and other languages
	 like Perl, Ruby, PHP, and more.

    ::Example cases of using Shadow Suite Framework
        -Aiding penetration testers for their penetraion tests.
	    + Shadow Suite Framework can aid penetration testers in auditing the network
	      they are permitted to test. Testers can use SSF alongside other tools or
	      frameworks.

	-Simple Security Audits and Penetration Tests.
	    + Authorized personell can also use Shadow Suite Framework, without using
	      other tools or frameworks. SSF has modules from reconnaissance to post-
	      exploitation. SSF module features are effective on simple networks with
	      simple security.

=========================================================================================
02.Installation

    Shadow Suite Framework is cross-platform, and can run on various operating systems,
    as long as Python and other dependencies can be installed. Note that some antiviruses
    flag Shadow Suite Framework and some of its files as malware. Shadow Suite Framework
    has exploitation tools, so antiviruses may detect it.

    ::Installing on Linux, Termux Terminal Emulator (Android), and Cygwin Terminal Emulator (Windows)
        -SSF is tested on Kali Linux 2.0, Linux Mint 17.0, Ubuntu 17.0, Termux, and Cygwin.
	    1.Update package list. It can be achieved by typing 'apt update' in your shell
	      if you have APT package manager.

	    2.Install Git client. You can install Git by typing 'apt install git' in your
	      shell if you have APT package manager.

	    3.Clone the Shadow Suite Framework. Once the Git installation is finished,
	      You can now clone the repository by typing
	      'git clone https://github.com/Sh4d0w-T34m/ShadowSuiteFramework.git' in your
	      terminal.

	    4.Change working directory. Now the repository is cloned and downloaded,
	      change the working directory to ~/ShadowSuiteFramework/src by typing
	      'cd ShadowSuiteFramework/src/' in your terminal.

	    5.Install primary dependencies. You need Python interpreter to use Shadow
	      Suite Framework. Type 'apt install python3 python3-dev' in your terminal
	      to download python 3 and the python 3 development files.

	    6.Change file mode. Type 'chmod 755 SSF.py' to change SSF.py mode bits to
	      executable.

	    7.Run SSF as root. Type 'sudo ./SSF.py' to run SSF as root. You can also
	      run SSF without root, but some modules and features will be unavailable.

	    8.Configure Shadow Suite Framework. Now you have executed SSF, a First-run
	      wizard will show up. This wizard will run automatically if the specific
	      dat file is not present. If desired, read the license file by entering 'r'.
	      If you don't agree to the terms of the license, you can type "q" and
	      delete the cloned repository. Otherwise, type the 'captcha' and press enter
	      to continue. After the license agreement, It will ask you if you want to
	      perform a full update. Type 'y' or 'yes' to perform a full update,
	      Otherwise, type 'n' or 'no'. It is recommended that you perform a full
	      update to avoid 'ModuleNotFoundError' or 'ImportError' exceptions and to
	      use modules without errors. If you choosed no, you can perform a full update
	      later inside SSF terminal. After the full update, enter your username,
	      password, root username, and root password.

	    9.You have now successfully installed Shadow Suite Framework!

    ::Installing on Windows
        -Shadow Suite Framework is not yet tested on Windows, please inform us if it
	 works in your system.
