01.Introduction

    ::What is Shadow Suite Framework?
        -Shadow Suite Framework is an ethical hacking toolkit, made by the Shadow Team.
	 The framework is made up by scripts made by different authors, in different
	 languages. As of this writing, Shadow Suite Framework has 41 modules installed.
	 Written mainly in Python, and other languages like Perl, Ruby, PHP, and more.

    ::Example cases of using Shadow Suite Framework
        -Aiding penetration testers for their penetraion tests.
	    + Shadow Suite Framework can aid penetration testers in auditing the network
	      they are permitted to test. Testers can use SSF alongside other tools or
	      frameworks.

	-Simple Security Audits and Penetration Tests.
	    + Authorized personell can also use Shadow Suite Framework, without using
	      other tools or frameworks. SSF has modules from reconnaissance to post-
	      exploitation. SSF module features are effective on simple networks with
	      simple security.

=========================================================================================
02.Installation

    Shadow Suite Framework is cross-platform, and can run on various operating systems,
    as long as Python and other dependencies can be installed. Note that some antiviruses
    flag Shadow Suite Framework and some of its files as malware. Shadow Suite Framework
    has exploitation tools decoded and decrypted, so antiviruses may detect it.

    ::Installing on Linux Operating Systems
        -SSF is tested on Kali, Mint, and Ubuntu.
	    1.Update package list. It can be achieved by typing 'sudo apt update' in your
	      shell if you have APT package manager.

	    2.Install Git client. You can install Git by typing 'sudo apt install git' in
	      your shell if you have APT package manager.

	    3.Clone the Shadow Suite Framework. Once the Git installation is finished,
	      You can now clone the repository by typing
	      'git clone https://gitlab.com/Catayao56/ShadowSuiteFramework.git' in your
	      terminal.

	    4.Change working directory. Now the repository is cloned and downloaded,
	      change the working directory to ~/ShadowSuiteFramework/src by typing
	      'cd ShadowSuiteFramework/src/' in your terminal.

	    5.Install primary dependencies. You need Python interpreter to use Shadow
	      Suite Framework. Type 'sudo apt install python3 python3-dev' in your
	      terminal to download python 3 and the python 3 development files.

	    6.Change file mode. Type 'chmod 755 SSF.py' to change SSF.py mode bits to
	      executable.

	    7.Run SSF as root. Type 'sudo ./SSF.py' to run SSF as root. You can also
	      run SSF without root, but some modules and features will be unavailable.

	    8.Configure Shadow Suite Framework. Now you have executed SSF, a First-run
	      wizard will show up. This wizard will run automatically if the specific
	      dat file is not present. If desired, read the license file by entering 'r'.
	      If you don't agree to the terms of the license, you can type "q" and
	      delete the cloned repository. Otherwise, type the 'captcha' and press enter
	      to continue. After the license agreement, It will ask you if you want to
	      perform a full update. Type 'y' or 'yes' to perform a full update,
	      Otherwise, type 'n' or 'no'. It is recommended that you perform a full
	      update to avoid 'ModuleNotFoundError' or 'ImportError' exceptions and to
	      use modules without errors. If you choosed no, you can perform a full update
	      later inside SSF terminal. After the full update, enter your username,
	      password, root username, and root password.

	    9.You have now successfully installed Shadow Suite Framework!

    ::Installing on Windows
        -Shadow Suite Framework is not yet tested on Windows, please inform us if it
	 works in your system.

    ::Installing on Termux Terminal Emulator (Android)
        -The first versions of Shadow Suite is tested only on Termux. But with the
	 help and cooperation of Ethical Hackers vs. Noobs (EHVSN), it is now
	 crossplatform. Follow the guide below to install SSF on Termux.
	    
	    1.Fire up Termux. (Launch Termux)

	    2.When successfully launched, type 'apt update && apt upgrade -y'.
	      This will update the repository and upgrade all packages to newest versions.

	    3.Install Git client. Type 'apt install git' to install.

	    4.Clone the Shadow Suite Framework. Once the Git installation is finished,
	      You can now clone the repository by typing
	      'git clone https://gitlab.com/Catayao56/ShadowSuiteFramework.git' in your
	      terminal.

	    5.Change directory to ShadowSuiteFramework/src. to change directory, type
	      'cd ShadowSuiteFramework/src'.

	    6.Fix Shebang. If you already installed 'termux-tools', you can automate the
	      process by typing 'termux-fix-shebang SSF.py' or open 'SSF.py' with a text
	      editor (e.g.: vi, vim, nano) and replace '#!/usr/bin/env python3' to
	      '#!$PREFIX/bin/env python3'.

	    7.Change file mode. type 'chmod 755 SSF.py'.

	    8.Run SSF. type './SSF.py'.

	    9.Configure Shadow Suite Framework. Now you have executed SSF, a First-run
              wizard will show up. This wizard will run automatically if the specific
              dat file is not present. If desired, read the license file by entering 'r'.
              If you don't agree to the terms of the license, you can type "q" and

    ::The 'update' command
        -We already performed a full update on Chapter 2. Now, we are going to use other
	 methods of update.

	     1.Program update
	         + If you want to update the framework, modules, and services, but not
		   dependencies, you can use the 'update program' command. At the time
		   of this writing, it is equivalent of manually typing 'git pull' in
		   your terminal.

             2.Dependency update
	         + If you want to update only the dependencies, you can use
		   'update dependencies' command.

             3.Full update
	         + This is the command we used on Chapter 2, but it was automated by
		   the first-run wizard. So to perform a full update, type 'update all'.

    ::The 'config' command
        -The 'config' command helps you to customize SSF to suit your needs and feel.

	    1.Changing your username
	         + To change your username, type 'config username [NEW USERNAME]'.
		 + If the root credentials on SSF is set, SSF may ask for it.

            2.Changing your password
	         + To change your password, type 'config password'. An interactive
		   dialog will appear asking for the old password, if its already set.
		   If not, it will ask for the new password, and you need to repeat
		   it after.
		 + If the root credentials on SSF is set, SSF may ask for it.

            3.Changing your root username
	         + To change your root username, type 'config rootname [NEW ROOTNAME]'.
		 + If the root credentials on SSF is set, SSF may ask for it.

	    4.Changing your root password
	         + To change your root password, type 'config rootpass'. An interactive
		   dialog will appear asking for the old rootpass, if its already set.
		   If not, it will ask for the new password, and you will need to repeat
		   it after.

		 + If the root credentials on SSF is set, SSF may ask for it.
