# Full Feature List
------------------------
+ Open Source
      -Shadow Suite is protected by the GNU General Public License, means

       Just give "creds" to us and the developers that made the awesome
       tools :)

+ Create Custom Modules from template
      -Do you know Python? Do you know how to code in Python? Do you want
       to create your own module that can penetration test a Class A network
       in just three seconds? (exagerrated) Shadow Suite Framework provides
       a module template to help you start creating your custom module. It also
       provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to help you on
       the integration of Shadow Suite Framework and your custom module.

       You can also submit your custom module to us to make it pre-installed!

+ Pre-installed modules
      -It's okay if you don't know how to program. Shadow Suite Framework has an
       arsenal! It provides you tools written in different languages. Python,
       Ruby, Perl, PHP, and many more!
