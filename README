Shadow Suite 0.0.4.2 :: Ethical Hacking Toolkit
Copyright (C) 2017 :: Shadow Team <Public.ShadowTeam@gmail.com>
================
Shadow Suite is an Ethical Hacking Toolkit.
It was born on Thursday, Dec 7 2:44:37 PM, 2017.
It provides many tools that you can use, written
mainly in Python, BASH, PHP, etc. Tools that you
need for reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation,
encryption, password cracking, and more! Shadow
Suite is the main project of Shadow Team.

What's new?
------------------
1.Fixed some bugs and added a new tool.

Full Feature List
------------------------
-Friendly CLI
      -As most people know, Command-Line Interfaces (CLI) are very hard to
       use. But this framework is different. The commands does not need
       arguments, instead they ask you interactively. For example, it needs
       three arguments. Then the command will ask you "Will i enable this?",
       "Do i need to do that?", "which file should i work on?", blah, blah,
       blah.

-Open Source
      -Shadow Suite is protected by the GNU General Public License, means
       that you can freely download, modify, and distribute the software.
       Just give "creds" to us and the developers that made the awesome
       tools ;)

-Create Custom Modules from template
      -Do you know Python? Do you know how to code in Python 3? Do you want
       to create your own module that can penetration test a highly secured
       computers in just three seconds? Shadow Suite provides you a module
       template to help you start creating your custom module. It also
       provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to help you on
       the integration of Shadow Suite and your custom module.

-Pre-installed modules
      -It's okay if you don't know how to program. Shadow Suite has an
       arsenal! It provides you tools written in different languages, Python,
       Ruby, Perl, etc.

-Third-Party Frameworks Integration
      -There are pros and cons in every software, as well as frameworks.
       So Shadow Team decided to integrate Shadow Suite with other frameworks,
       such as the "Hakku Framework". Hakku Framework provides different
       modules, and Shadow Suite also provides different tools.

TO-DO List
------------------------

1.Add more modules.

2.Figure out how to automatically install custom modules.

3.Fix bugs.

4.Code more modules from different sources...

5.VARIABLE.lower()

Requirements
------------------------
1.Internet Connection. (for performing remote attacks)
2.Python Interpreter version 3.
3.Dependencies can be installed automatically in the program. (Needs Internet Connection)


Installing & Running
------------------------
1.Installing and Running
      -Enter these commands in your terminal:

      $ apt update && apt upgrade [1]
      $ apt install python python-dev git [2]
      $ git clone https://github.com/Sh4d0w-T34m/ShadowSuite/ [3]
      $ cd ShadowSuite/src && chmod +x ShadowSuite.py [4]
      $ ./ShadowSuite.py [5]
      [Shadow] $ full update [6]
      [Shadow] $ help [7]

      [1] Update repository package list/s.
      [2] Install Python interpreters and Git client.
      [3] Clone Shadow Suite from Shadow Team's Github repository.
      [4] Changes directory to ShadowSuite/src and changes file mode to executable.
      [5] Run 'ShadowSuite.py'.
      [6] Type 'full update' on Shadow Suite's console to update
          the program and dependencies.
      [7] Type 'help' on Shadow Suite's console to see the help menu.

2.Debugging

      -This is not actually debugging. I used this for developing Shadow Suite.
      If you run Shadow Suite via the debug script, it will not write .pyc files
      on import, prints a message each time a module is initialized, showing
      the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded, and
      another message for each file that is checked for when searching
      for a module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.

      -To start Shadow Suite in debugging mode, enter this command in your terminal:

      $ bash debug

      This will automatically run the command 'python -vv -B ShadowSuite.py'.
