Shadow Suite 0.0.3.5 :: Ethical Hacking Toolkit
Copyright (C) 2017 :: Shadow Team <Public.ShadowTeam@gmail.com>
================
Shadow Suite is an Ethical Hacking Toolkit.
It provides many tools that you can use, written
in Python, BASH, PHP, etc. Tools that you need for
reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, encryption,
password cracking, and more! Shadow Suite is
the main project of Shadow Team.

What's new?
------------------
1.Module Template
      -We now have implemented a feature to let you create your own module!

2.Pre-installed modules
      -Our currently pre-installed modules are DNSMap and NWrap. More are
       coming soon!

Full Feature List
------------------------
-Friendly CLI
      -As most people know, Command-Line Interfaces (CLI) are very hard to
       use. But this framework is different. The commands does not need
       arguments, instead they ask you interactively. For example, it needs
       three arguments. Then the command will ask you "Will i enable this?",
       "Do i need to do that?", "which file should i work on?", blah, blah,
       blah.

-Open Source
      -Shadow Suite is protected by the GNU General Public License, means
       that you can freely download, modify, and distribute the software.
       Just give "creds" to me ;)

-Create Custom Modules from template
      -Do you know Python? Do you know how to code in Python 3? Do you want
       to create your own module that can penetration test a highly secured
       computers in just three seconds? Shadow Suite provides you a module
       template to help you start creating your custom module. It also
       provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to help you on
       the integration of Shadow Suite and your custom module.

-Pre-installed modules
      -It's okay if you don't know how to program. Shadow Suite has an
       arsenal! It provides you tools written in different languages, Python,
       Ruby, Perl, etc.

-Third-Party Frameworks Integration
      -There are pros and cons in every software, as well as frameworks.
       So Shadow Team decided to integrate Shadow Suite with other frameworks,
       such as the "Hakku Framework". Hakku Framework provides different
       modules, and Shadow Suite also provides different tools.
