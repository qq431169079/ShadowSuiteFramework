Shadow Suite Linux Edition 0.0.6.0 :: Ethical Hacking Toolkit
Copyright (C) 2017-2018 :: Shadow Team <Public.ShadowTeam@gmail.com>
================
Shadow Suite Linux Edition is an Ethical Hacking Toolkit.
It was born on Thursday, Dec 7 2:44:37 PM, 2017.
It provides many tools that you can use,
written mainly in Python, BASH, PHP, etc.
Tools that you need for reconnaissance, scanning,
exploitation, encryption, password cracking, and more!
Shadow Suite is the main project of Shadow Team.
If you only have a windows computer, you should look
for Shadow Suite Windows Edition.

What's new?
------------------
1.This is now the linux edition... We will have the windows edition!

2.Participation in this project is open to anyone. :)

Full Feature List
------------------------
-Friendly CLI
      -As most people know, Command-Line Interfaces (CLI) are very hard to
       use. But this framework is different. The commands does not need
       arguments, instead they ask you interactively. For example, it needs
       three arguments. Then the command will ask you "Will i enable this?",
       "Do i need to do that?", "which file should i work on?", and so on.

-Open Source
      -Shadow Suite is protected by the GNU General Public License, means
       that you can freely download, modify, and distribute the software.
       Just give "creds" to us and the developers that made the awesome
       tools :)

-Create Custom Modules from template
      -Do you know Python? Do you know how to code in Python 3? Do you want
       to create your own module that can penetration test a Class A network
       in just three seconds? (exagerrated) Shadow Suite provides you a module
       template to help you start creating your custom module. It also
       provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to help you on
       the integration of Shadow Suite and your custom module.

-Pre-installed modules
      -It's okay if you don't know how to program. Shadow Suite has an
       arsenal! It provides you tools written in different languages, Python,
       Ruby, Perl, PHP, and many more!
