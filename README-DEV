README for Developers

1.How the code is structured?

      -The program is now ported to Python 3. The program has been
       broken down into little pieces called 'modules'. The Shadow
       Suite API provides methods to integrate with Shadow Suite
       Framework.

2.Comment Tags

      -Comment tags are used to easily understand
       the logic of a program. The comment tags
       labels the code if it has errors, needs to
       be frequently updated, where you left off,
       and more.
           
	   -Comment tags definitions and examples

	        DEV0001 : Requires Attention Tag
		DEV0002 : Frequently Update Tag
		DEV0003 : Where You Left Your Code (WYLYC) Tag
		DEV0004 : Under Construction Tag
		DEV0005 : Mentioned line is for debugging purposes.
		          Comment the mentioned line if not debugging.
		DEV0006 : Feature request Tag

3.Program Development Cycle

      -Shadow Suite Framework uses the 'Shadow Team Software Development Cycle'.

4.New framework module (For Framework Contributors):
      -If you want to contribute and wanted to create a new framework module
       (like misc.py or manage_module.py module), you need to follow these
       guidelines:
               
	       - Always follow the PEP 0008 Guideline.
	       - Use meaningful function and variable names.
	       - Always use the logger.py module to log information.
	       - Create a cross-platform module.
	       - All modules must accept arguments that is needed like " SESSION_ID, misc.debugging, misc.failsafe, and more important information."
