README for Developers

1.How the code is structured?

      -At the beginning, The license is commented.
       below the license, include and define
       directives are placed. Function declarations
       comes next. Then what i called 'subfunctions'
       comes next, before the function. Then after
       the function, the main function comes last.
       It's like an inverted tree. because instead of:

       				Main
				 ^
				/ \
			       /   \
		       Function1   Function2
			 ^             ^
		 Subfunctions         Subfunctions



       This is the program's source code structure:



       		 Subfunctions         Subfunctions
		         v              v
		       Function1   Function2
		               \   /
			        \ /
			         v
				Main



2.Comment Tags

      -Comment tags are used to easily understand
       the logic of a program. The comment tags
       labels the code if it has errors, needs to
       be frequently updated, where you left off,
       and more.
           
	   -Comment tags definitions and examples

	        DEV0001 : Requires Attention Tag
		DEV0002 : Frequently Update Tag
		DEV0003 : Where You Left Your Code (WYLYC) Tag
		DEV0004 : Under Construction Tag
		DEV0005 : Mentioned line is for debugging purposes.
		          Comment the mentioned line if not debugging.
		DEV0006 : Feature request Tag

3.Program Development Cycle

      -Shadow Suite uses RAD Program Development Cycle.
       What we have in mind, we test it, then integrate it.
