# Shellshocker
A bash script that tests a list of hosts for the shellshock vulnerability. It does so by sending the payload:

```
'() { :; };echo;/bin/cat /etc/passwd
```
Via curl to each URL in the list respectively, per line, in sequence.

To use this script start ```shellshocker.sh``` from your terminal and select the 'List' option to specify a path to a list of URLs to be tested, in example 
```
'Path to list: /tmp/list.txt', 
```
After doing so you can select the 'Output' option to specify a location to which a copy of the script's output will be saved. 
This option is not mandatory however and output will be printed to the STDOUT regardless of whether it is set or not.

Finally after a list of URLs has been loaded you can test them for the shellshock vulnerability by selecting the 'Test' option. 
If any given host is vulnerable the contents of their /etc/passwd will be retrieved and printed to the terminal.
Upon completion the script will exit.

# Known issue

From time to time when testing a list of URLs HTML documents are retrieved as well together with the results from the command injection when executed succesfully.
