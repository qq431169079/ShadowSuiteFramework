README for Developers

1.How the code is structured?

      -The code is only in one file, and does not need
       anything, except Pwgen and BASH Shell.

2.Comment Tags

      -Comment tags are used to easily understand
       the logic of a program. The comment tags
       labels the code if it has errors, needs to
       be frequently updated, where you left off,
       and more.
