===PROFESSIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT===

Section 1: Principal Values

      1.0: How hackers are judged

           -Hackers should be judged by their hacking,
            not bogus criteria such as academic
            excellence, age, race, nor position.

      1.1: Access to Computers

           -Access to computers, and anything which
            might teach you something about the way
            the world works, should be unlimited and
            total.

      1.2: Freedom of Information

           -All information should be free. Whether
            it is useful or not, you should let the
            other people know what is happening.

      1.3: Decentralization

           -Mistrust Authority. Promote
            Decentralization. Authorities don't
            expose information to public, unless
            they wanted us to know, putting us
            inside the cells.

      1.4: Art and Beauty

           -Remember that you can create art and
            beauty on a computer.

      1.5: Promises

           -A hacker must do his promises.

Section 2: The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics

      2.0: Harming other people
      
           -Thou shalt not use a computer to harm
            other people.
            
           -Do not use the computer in ways that may
            harm other people. This commandment says
            that it is unethical to use a computer
            to harm another user. It is not limited
            to physical injury. It includes harming
            or corrupting other users' data or files.
            The commandment states that it is wrong
            to use a computer to steal someone's
            personal information. Manipulating or
            destroying files of other users is
            ethically wrong. It is unethical to
            write programs, which on execution lead
            to stealing, copying or gaining
            unauthorized access to other users'
            data. Being involved in practices like
            hacking, spamming, phishing or cyber
            bullying does not conform to computer
            ethics.
      
      2.1: Interfering with other people's computer work
      
           -Thou shalt not interfere with other
            people's computer work.
      
           -Do not use computer technology to cause
            interference in other users' work.
            Computer software can be used in ways
            that disturb other users or disrupt
            their work. Viruses, for example, are
            programs meant to harm useful computer
            programs or interfere with the normal
            functioning of a computer. Malicious
            software can disrupt the functioning of
            computers in more ways than one. It may
            overload computer memory through excessive
            consumption of computer resources, thus
            slowing its functioning. It may cause a
            computer to function wrongly or even stop
            working. Using malicious software to
            attack a computer is unethical.
      
      2.2: Snooping in other people's computer files
      
           -Thou shalt not snoop around in other
            people's computer files.
      
           -Do not spy on another person's computer
            data. We know it is wrong to read
            someone's personal letters. On the same
            lines, it is wrong to read someone else's
            email messages or files. Obtaining data
            from another person's private files is
            nothing less than breaking into someone's
            room. Snooping around in another person's
            files or reading someone else's personal
            messages is the invasion of his privacy.
            There are exceptions to this. For example,
            spying is necessary and cannot be called
            unethical when it is done against
            illegitimate use of computers. For example,
            intelligence agencies working on cybercrime
            cases need to spy on the internet activity
            of suspects.
      
      2.3: Stealing
      
           -Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
      
           -Do not use computer technology to steal
            information. Stealing sensitive information
            or leaking confidential information is as
            good as robbery. It is wrong to acquire
            personal information of employees from an
            employee database or patient history from a
            hospital database or other such information
            that is meant to be confidential. Similarly,
            breaking into a bank account to collect
            information about the account or account
            holder is wrong. Illegal electronic transfer
            of funds is a type of fraud. With the use of
            technology, stealing of information is much
            easier. Computers can be used to store
            stolen information.
      
      2.4: False Witness
      
           -Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false
            witness.
      
           -Do not contribute to the spread of
            misinformation using computer technology.
            Spread of information has become viral today,
            because of the Internet. This also means that
            false news or rumors can spread speedily
            through social networking sites or emails.
            Being involved in the circulation of
            incorrect information is unethical. Mails and
            pop-ups are commonly used to spread the wrong
            information or give false alerts with the
            only intent of selling products. Mails from
            untrusted sources advertising certain products
            or spreading some hard-to-believe information,
            are not uncommon. Direct or indirect
            involvement in the circulation of false
            information is ethically wrong. Giving wrong
            information can hurt other parties or
            organizations that are affected by that
            particular theme.
      
      2.5: Piracy
      
           -Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary
            software for which you have not paid,
            without permission.
      
           -Refrain from copying software or buying
            pirated copies. Pay for software unless
            it is free. Like any other artistic or
            literary work, software is copyrighted.
            A piece of code is the original work of the
            individual who created it. It is copyrighted
            in his/her name. In case of a developer writing
            software for the organization she works for,
            the organization holds the copyright for it.
            Copyright holds true unless its creators
            announce it is not. Obtaining illegal copies
            of copyrighted software is unethical and also
            encourages others to make copies illegally.
      
      2.6: Using other people's computer resources
      
           -Thou shalt not use other people's computer
            resources without authorization or proper
            compensation.
            
           -Do not use someone else's computer resources
            unless authorized to. Multi-user systems have
            user specific passwords. Breaking into some
            other user's password, thus intruding his/her
            private space is unethical. It is not ethical
            to hack passwords for gaining unauthorized
            access to a password-protected computer system.
            Accessing data that you are not authorized to
            access or gaining access to another user's computer
            without her permission is not ethical.
      
      2.7: Appropriation
      
           -Thou shalt not appropriate other people's
            intellectual output.
            
           -It is wrong to claim ownership on a work which
            is the output of someone else's intellect.
            Programs developed by a software developer are
            her property. If he is working with an
            organization, they are the organization's
            property. Copying them and propagating them in
            one's own name is unethical. This applies to any
            creative work, program or design. Establishing
            ownership on a work which is not yours is ethically
            wrong.
      
      2.8: Social Consequences
      
           -Thou shalt think about the social consequences
            of the program you are writing or the system
            you are designing.
            
           -Before developing a software, think about the
            social impact it can have. Looking at the social
            consequences that a program can have, describes a
            broader perspective of looking at technology. A
            computer software on release, reaches millions.
            Software like video games and animations or
            educational software can have a social impact on
            their users. When working on animation films or
            designing video games, for example, it is the
            programmer's responsibility to understand his
            target audience/users and the effect it may have
            on them. For example, a computer game for kids
            should not have content that can influence them
            negatively. Similarly, writing malicious software
            is ethically wrong. A software developer/development
            firm should consider the influence their code can
            have on the society at large.
      
      2.9: Consideration and Respect

           -Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure
            consideration and respect for your fellow humans.
            
           -In using computers for communication, be respectful
            and courteous with the fellow members. The
            communication etiquette we follow in the real world
            applies to communication over computers as well.
            While communicating over the Internet, one should
            treat others with respect. One should not intrude
            others' private space, use abusive language, make
            false statements or pass irresponsible remarks about
            others. One should be courteous while communicating
            over the web and should respect others' time and
            resources. Also, one should be considerate with a
            novice computer user.

Section 3: The right of Privacy

      3.0: Copyright
      
           -Computer programs are protected as literary works.
            Authors of computer programs and producers of sound
            recordings have the right to prohibit the commercial
            rental of their works to the public.
            
      3.1: Patent
      
           -Patent protection must be available for inventions
            for at least 20 years and for both products and processes
            in almost all fields of technology. (Controversy has arisen
            over whether this protection applies to computer software.)
            
      3.2: Trade Secrets
           
           -Trade secrets and other types of undisclosed information
            that have commercial value must be protected against breach of
            confidence and other acts that are contrary to honest commercial
            practices. However, reasonable steps must have been taken to
            keep the information secret.
      
Section 4: The right of Equality

      4.0: 
      
           -

Section 5: Intellectual Property

      5.0: 
      
           -

Section 6: Programming ethics

      6.0: Contribution
      
           -Contribute to society and human well-being. Programmers should
            work to develop computer systems that can reduce negative
            consequences to society, such as threats to safety and health,
            and that can make everyday activities and work easier. It is
            an obligation to develop to high standards (Savage).

      6.1: Harm
      
           -Avoid harm to others. Computer systems have an indirect impact
            on third parties. They can cause loss of information and
            resources that might result severely harmful for users, the
            general public, or employers. Therefore, software developers
            should minimize the risk of harming others due to coding
            errors, or security issues, by following standards to design
            and test systems (Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct).
            
      6.2: Honesty and Trustworthy
      
           -Be honest and trustworthy. This principle encourages
            programmers to be honest and aware of their limitations in
            knowledge and education when writing computer systems.
            Also, if a programmer knows there is something wrong with a
            computer system, he or she should report it immediately to
            avoid undesirable consequences.
            
      6.3: Intellectual Property
      
           -Give proper credit for intellectual property. It is mandatory
            for every software developer to never use and take credit for
            someone else's work, even when it has not been protected by a
            copyright law, patent, etc. They must recognize and fully
            credit other people's works, and they should use their own
            ideas to develop software.
            
      6.4: Privacy
      
           -Respect the privacy of others. Computer systems are wrongly
            used by some people to violate the privacy of others. Software
            developers should write programs that can protect users' private
            information and that can avoid other undesired people to have
            unauthorized access to it (Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct).
            
      6.5: Confidentiality
      
           -Honor confidentiality. Unless required by law or any other ethical
            guideline, a programmer must keep secret any additional information
            related to his or her employer that arises from working in a project.
            
      6.6: Software Approval
      
           -Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief it is safe
            and meets specifications. Programmers cannot assume that a system is
            ready to use only because it performs the tasks needed. They should
            make sure these systems are also safe and meet every specification
            required by the user. If programs are not safe, users are unprotected
            from hackers that could steal important information or money.
            Therefore, several tests should be performed in order to ensure a
            system's security before approving it.
            
      6.7: Responsibility
      
           -Accept full responsibility for their own work. If a program presents
            errors, the software developer should accept full responsibility for
            his or her work, and should work on revising, correcting, modifying,
            and testing it.
            
      6.8: Not knowingly use software that is obtained illegally

           -Not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either
            illegally or unethically. If a computer system will be used as a base
            for the creation of another, then permission to do so should be asked
            by the programmer. This principle prohibits using any other software
            for any purpose if the way it was gotten is not clear or is known to
            be illegal or unethical.
            
      6.9: Identify, define, and address issues related to work projects
      
           -Identify, define, and address ethical, economic, cultural, legal
            and environmental issues related to work projects. If a programmer
            notices and identifies that working on a project will lead to any
            kind of problems, then the programmer should report it to his or her
            employer before continuing.
            
      6.A: User Satisfaction
      
           -Ensure that specifications for software on which they work satisfy the
            users' requirements and they have the appropriate approvals. Software
            developers should come to their employers to ask for the correspondent
            approval to the system they are creating before continuing working on
            the next part. If it doesn't meet the requirements, then a modification
            to the source code of the system should be made.
           
      6.B: Ensure adequate testing, debugging and review of software
           
           -Ensure adequate testing, debugging and review of software. Programmers
            should perform the appropriate tests to the pieces of software they
            work with, and should check for errors and system security holes to make
            sure that the programs are well implemented.
           
      6.C: Financial Deception
      
           -Not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double
            billing, or other improper financial practices. Programmers are exposed
            to be participants in illegal activities to get money. They get involved
            in them due to threats, economic issues, or simply because they want to
            obtain easy money by taking advantage of their knowledge about how
            computer systems work. This guideline prohibits programmer involvement
            in such unlawful actions.
            
      6.D: Quality Software Creation
      
           -Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality
            software. Since technology advances faster year by year, and so does
            virtual criminality, the need of well-structured and designed programs
            is increasing. Computer systems get old and limited by new ones and new
            devices. Programmers should further their knowledge of developments in
            the analysis, specification, design, development, maintenance, and
            testing software and related documents (Software Engineering Code of
            Ethics and Professional Practice)[4] in order to create better pieces
            of software.
