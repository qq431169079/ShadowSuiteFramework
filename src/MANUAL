Part I: Compilation and Installation

1.Installation

	Compiling and installing Shadow Suite on Termux is easy. You
	don't need to modify the source code. But if you want to run
	Shadow Suite on a different operating system, you need to
	modify some of it to properly compile and run it.

		a.Modify the source code if necessary.
		
		b.Compile source code.

		c.Optional: copy Shadow Suite to PATH.

	type the needed information and Shadow Suite will do the job for
	you. At first startup, There will be the Tools categorized by their
	use.
	
		[1] Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
		[2] Scanning
		[3] Encryption and Password Cracking
		[4] Exploitation
		[5] Denial-of-Service (Stress Testing)
		[6] Session Hijacking

		[96] License
		[97] Manual
		[98] Install Dependencies
		[99] Exit
	
	And you can notice that there is also an extra selection
	that starts at the line of nine.

	[1] Reconnaissance

	This section is for Information Gathering phase of Ethical Hacking.
	All tools here is for gathering all required tools for reconnaissance
	(Information Gathering). You can find Red hawk, Social Engineer Toolkit,
	and Metagoofil in this section.

	[2] Scanning

	This section is for the Scanning phase of Ethical Hacking. All tools
	here are used to scan a remote host, scan for open ports, scan for
	vulnerabilities, etc. You can find Nmap and Cisco Auditing Tool here.

	[3] Encryption and Password Cracking

	This section is for the password cracking phase of Ethical Hacking. All
	tools here is for cracking encrypted passwords, encipher a string, and

	[4] Exploitation

	This section included the tools used for exploitation. A famous tool
	which is included here is Metasploit Framework.

	[5] Denial-of-Service

	This section is of course, used for denial-of-service attacks. Tools
	included here are UFOnet, fl00d, and slowloris.

	[6] Session Hijacking

	This section is for session hijacking attacks. It is hard to find a
	reliable one so the only tool here is A-Rat.

	[96] License

	This option shows the license of the software.

	[97] Manual

	This option shows the manual of the sofrware. You currently viewing
