Part I: Compilation and Installation

1.Installation

	Compiling and installing Shadow Suite on Termux is easy. You
	don't need to modify the source code. But if you want to run
	Shadow Suite on a different operating system, you need to
	modify some of it to properly compile and run it.

		a.Modify the source code if necessary.
		
		b.Compile source code.

		c.Optional: copy Shadow Suite to PATH.

		d.Run Shadow Suite.





Part II: Usage

1.User Interface

	Shadow Suite's user interface is user-friendly. You only need to
	type the needed information and Shadow Suite will do the job for
	you. At first startup, There will be the Tools categorized by their
	use.
	
		[1] Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
		[2] Scanning

	And you can notice that there is also an extra selection
	that starts at the line of nine.

	[1] Reconnaissance

	This section is for Information Gathering phase of Ethical Hacking.
	All tools here is for gathering all required tools for reconnaissance
	(Information Gathering). You can find Red hawk, Social Engineer Toolkit,
	and Metagoofil in this section.

	[2] Scanning

	This section is for the Scanning phase of Ethical Hacking. All tools
	here are used to scan a remote host, scan for open ports, scan for
	vulnerabilities, etc. You can find Nmap and Cisco Auditing Tool here.

	[3] Encryption and Password Cracking

	This section is for the password cracking phase of Ethical Hacking. All
	tools here is for cracking encrypted passwords, encipher a string, and
	more. You can find Shadow Crack, Random Pass, and CUPP in this section.

	[4] Exploitation

	This section included the tools used for exploitation. A famous tool
	which is included here is Metasploit Framework.

	This section is of course, used for denial-of-service attacks. Tools
	included here are UFOnet, fl00d, and slowloris.

	[6] Session Hijacking

	This section is for session hijacking attacks. It is hard to find a
	reliable one so the only tool here is A-Rat.

	[96] License

2.Quick Start

	1.Compile Shadow Suite.

	2.Run Shadow Suite.

	3.For first run, select the option 98, which is to install dependencies.
	  You need internet connectivity to successfully install the
	  dependencies.

3.Tools User Interface

	In every tools in this toolkit, it has different types of user interface.
	Some have friendly ones, some have interactive ones, some have user
	interface that needs to be understand carefully.

	Some tools accepts input only via command-line arguments. Hopefully,
	Shadow Suite developers coded some wrapper scripts to make them
	more user-friendly.

	Almost all operations are done by Shadow Suite. From changing directory,
	to running scripts and tools. All it needs is the necessary informations
	to properly launch the tool.

4.Tools Usage

	I.Reconnaissance Tools

	III.Encryption and Password Cracking Tools
	
		1.Random Pass
		   Random Pass, created by Shadow Team, is a random
		   password block generator that uses PWGen password
		   generator. Just run it, press enter, copy the password
		   block, press enter again, and you're done.
		
		2.Shadow Crack
		   Shadow Crack is a hash generator and at the same time,
		   hash cracker. To use Shadow Crack, run it from Shadow
		   Suite. Type 'e' or 'E' to encrypt a string, and 'c' or
		   'C' to crack a hash. ShadowCrk supports MD5, SHA1, 
           SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 hash types.
           
        3.Black Hydra
           Black Hydra is a tool to Shorten brute force sessions
           on hydra. Hydra is a very fast network logon cracker
           which support many different services. To start, run
           Black Hydra and the rest will be on-board.
           
        4.Hash Buster
           Hash buster is a hash cracker tool that use several
           online hash crackers to find cleartext of a hash in
           less than 5 seconds. But it has some limitations.
           It cannot crack unique passwords. it cannot crack
           hashes with the plaintext:
           
           Ijwnsni(ayz66atwu2op=d=_0(zp9&%$[\wkd]nxJ@o(@
           
           But it can crack i think one-word hashes like:
           
           soldier
           sysadmin
           hacker
           
           To start, run Hash Buster and enter your hash, then
           Hash Buster will do the rest.
           
        5.Hash Identifier
           Hash Identifier, as the name implies, identifies the
           hash type of the given hash. It does not crack. It
           does not hack. It only gives you the type of your
		   given hash. For example, i had a hash. I don't know
		   what hash type it is. So i will use Hash Identifier.
		   Run Hash Identifier and enter your hash. To quit,
		   type CTRL+C.
		
		6.Common User Passwords Profiler (CUPP)
		   Common User Passwords Profiler (CUPP) also does not
		   crack hashes. It does not hack. As the name implies,
		   It only profiles the *POSSIBLE* password of your
		   victim. The developer said:

		   A weak password might be very short or only use
           alphanumberic characters, making decryption simple.
		   A weak password can also be one that is easily
		   guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a
		   birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet or
           relative, or a common word such as God, love,
           money or password.

		   To start, run CUPP from Shadow Suite. a menu will
		   appear. Choose the desired option, and an
           interactive questions will appear.
           
        7.Facebook Cracker
           Facebook Cracker is a tool to crack facebook
		   accounts. It simply tries every word in a selected
		   wordlist to be the password and if it matches,
		   the account is cracked. To use, run Facebook
		   Cracker from Shadow Suite. Enter the ID of the
		   Facebook account, located after the website URL.
		
		   https://www.facebook.com/MyTargetID
		
		   It can be a username, or a number. After that,
		   enter the wordlist you want to use. Type
           password.txt for default wordlist and the tool
           will start the cracking.
